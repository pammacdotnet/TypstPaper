= Affine Spaces:
Let $A$ be a linear subspace of another space $V$. Then, $A$ is a Euclidean and affine linear space if there exists a mapping: $ f: A times A arrow.r V $ #v(-0.9em) where $A times A$ means _linear mapping that takes a tuple from $A$_.
#let b(x) = $bold(upright(x))$
= Example
Let the mapping $f$ take two elements $b(a) = (a_x, a_y)$ and $b(b) = (b_x, b_y)$ from $A subset.eq RR^2$ and do the following with them: $ f(b(a), b(b)) = (a_x-b_x, a_y-b_y) $
