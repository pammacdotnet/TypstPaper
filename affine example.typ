= Affine Spaces
Let $A$ be a linear subspace of another space $V$. We say that $A$ is a Euclidean and affine linear space if there exists a mapping such that:
$ f: A times A arrow.r V $
where $A times A$ means _linear mapping that takes a tuple from $A$_.
= Example
#let el(x) = math.bold(math.upright(x))
Let the mapping $f$ take two elements $ el(a) = (a_x, a_y)$ and $el(b) = (b_x, b_y)$ from $A subset.eq RR^2$ and do the following with them:
$ f(el(a), el(b)) = (a_x-b_x, a_y-b_y) $
