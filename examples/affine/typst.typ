= Affine Spaces
Let $A$ be a linear subspace of another space $V$. Then, $A$ is a Euclidean and affine linear space if there exists a mapping: $ f: A times A -> V $ where $A times A$ means _linear mapping that takes a tuple from $A$_.
#let bo(var) = $bold(upright(var))$
= Example
Let the mapping $f$ take two elements $bo(a) = (a_x, a_y)$ and $bo(b) = (b_x, b_y)$ from $A subset.eq RR^2$ and do the following with them: $ f(bo(a), bo(b)) = (a_x - b_x, a_y - b_y) $
