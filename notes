= Now:
microtypography and other stuff from 0.14.0-rc1
mention the interactive figure

From paper.typ:
Current minimal Universe distribution is around 442 MiB.
While TeX Live distribution can take 7+ GiB (https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). (187G)
"and a significantly improved user experience" sounds bad/backwards with the current phrasing. (248G)
inconsistent example/description narrative. (283G)
This table does not show the transitions between modes, like in a matrix. (287G)
First-class citizen, in my mind, is example where different Unicode characters are used as variable/function names, as it can be more practical sometimes to use native language to improve overall source readability. (305G)
Mention Neovim etc. (617G)
Wait for https://github.com/aargar1/atomic/pull/3 in Typst Universe. (779G)
If quad is added in the preview, it must be added in the code. (810G)



= After final review, before submission for publication:
regroup/restructure repository
maybe add space before footnotes
try to upstream gantty changes
remove explicit function in template
add image alt text?



= After submission for publication:
Remove leading whitespaces
Add missing EOF newlines
Add links to all fonts.

From paper.typ:
Add note about Noto Color Emoji being bad and glyphs not being centered, or use another one. (25G)
Wait for https://github.com/aargar1/atomic/pull/3 in Typst Universe. (953G)
