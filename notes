add image alt text?
check that all figures are referenced
check that all figures are in their respective sections (place.flush)

use codly code block (maybe disable line numbers in some cases)
make a better small Rust example code

https://github.com/notofonts/arabic
https://github.com/aiaf/kawkab-mono

make some figures unfloated (because of the bottom floating figure + place.flush not working bug)

explicitly state with which template commit paper was edited/compiled

remove periods from captions once the latest version is used

maybe add space before footnotes

capital letter for: tiaoma, siunitx, troff/TROFF, Runoff/RUNOFF, problemst, self-example

After review:
undo placement: none changes that are bugged (bottom figures don't respect flush)
change lists
make package links consistent
don't forget to replace Pythagorean theorem example
