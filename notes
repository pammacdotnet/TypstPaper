= Now:
use Codly code block (maybe disable line numbers in some cases)
make some figures unfloated (because of the bottom floating figure + place.flush not working bug)
use VSCodium (625G)
check that all figures are in their respective sections (place.flush)
Make sure that all code is correctly highlighted

From paper.typ:
Current minimal Universe distribution is around 442 MiB.
While TeX Live distribution can take 7+ GiB (https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). (187G)
"and a significantly improved user experience" sounds bad/backwards with the current phrasing. (248G)
remove "see"? (265G)
inconsistent example/description narrative. (283G)
This table doesn't show the transitions between modes, like in a matrix. (287G)
First-class citizen, in my mind, is example where different Unicode characters are used as variable/function names, as it can be more practical sometimes to use native language to improve overall source readability. (305G)
Why not include HTML? (532G)
Mention Neovim etc. (617G)
Wait for https://github.com/aargar1/atomic/pull/3 in Typst Universe. (779G)
If quad is added in the preview, it must be added in the code. (810G)
Change, for instance, the color of the milestones (1075G)



= After final review, before submission for publication:
link to Kantan
regroup/restructure repository
maybe add space before footnotes
try to upstream gantty changes
remove explicit function in template
add image alt text?
check that all figures are in their respective sections (place.flush)
Make sure that all code is correctly highlighted



= After submission for publication:
Add links to all fonts.
https://github.com/notofonts/arabic
https://github.com/aiaf/kawkab-mono
...

From paper.typ:
Add note about Noto Color Emoji being bad and glyphs not being centered, or use another one. (75G)
