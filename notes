Current minimal Universe distribution is around 442 MiB.
While TeX Live distribution can take 7+ GiB (https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). (187G)

Do table cells must be justified? The big spaces between words don't look good. (209G)
"and a significantly improved user experience" sounds bad/backwards with the current phrasing. (248G)
remove "see"? (265G)
inconsistent example/description narrative. (283G)

First-class citizen, in my mind, is example where different Unicode characters are used as variable/function names, as it can be more practical sometimes to use native language to improve overall source readability. (305G)
I expected a cetz-plot example here (443G)
Why not include HTML? (532G)
Mention Neovim etc. (617G)
Translate/rephrase? (769G)
Wait for https://github.com/aargar1/atomic/pull/3 in Typst Universe. (779G)
If quad is added in the preview, it must be added in the code. (810G)
