abstract = "Typst is a modern, markup-based typesetting system designed for creating professional documents with a focus on simplicity and performance. Combining a clean syntax with powerful scripting capabilities, it allows users to write structured content while automating layout and styling. Unlike LaTeX, which is known for its steep learning curve and verbose syntax, Typst offers a more intuitive approach. It compiles documents incrementally, enabling faster rendering compared to traditional engines. Typst also integrates built-in version control and collaborative features, addressing gaps in other typesetting systems workflow. Compared to other alternatives, Typst is lighter and more approachable, though LaTeX remains dominant in academia due to its extensive package ecosystem. Alternatives like Markdown (with Pandoc) are simpler but lack Typst's fine-grained control over layout. Microsoft Word and other WYSIWYG tools offer ease of use but fall short in reproducibility and automation. Typst strikes a balance, blending Markdown's readability with TeX's precision, while adding modern features like real-time collaboration. Its growing library of templates and functions positions it as a compelling alternative for technical writing, academic papers, and beyond."
